The classes are arranged in a hierarchical manner, starting\nwith the model class. The model class (or object), set's global\nparameters like the model name, the time step etc. Next comes one or\nmore element objects which define basic element properties. Each\nelement can have one or more species. Note that these classes specify\nunits, however at present, there is incomplete support for unit\nconversions. So it is up to the author to ensure proper unit\nconversions. It is therefore best, to use the same units throughout.\n\n![img](scheme1.png)\n\nAt present, these classes only specify the isotopic reference ratios,\nand plot labels.\n\nNext comes the source and sink class, which simply specify the name\nand species, followed by reservoir object which specifies things like\nreservoir name, reservoir size, reservoir species etc.  Each reservoir\ncan only have one element. This is counter intuitive since we would\nthink of the ocean as single reservoir with many elements. However,\nthe model only attempts to track the transfer of mass between\nreservoirs, for a given element. For multi element models, you need to\nsetup reservoirs and connections for each element.\n\nSources, sinks, and reservoirs are connected through fluxes, and\nfluxes are either forced by signals, or affected by processes. Most\nprocesses can be derived implicitly from the way we connect reservoirs\n(see below), however signal must be specified explicitly. It is thus\nbest to define these first (see the worked example below).\n\nThe connection between a source and a sink (or two reservoirs) is\nhandled by the connection class. This class will create the necessary\nfluxes, and where possible add processes. Fluxes and processes are\nalso implemented as objects.\n\n![img](scheme2.png)\n\nEach connector object can have more than one signal or process (or a\nmixture of signals and processes). Each reservoir can have more than\none connector object.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### A worked example\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the following example we will set up a simple carbon cycle\nmodel. The data forcing the anthropogenic carbon flux will be read\nfrom a csv file. Interaction with external data is handled through the\nexternal data object which allows to integrate external data into the\nmodel framework. It can then be used to generate a signal, or it can\nbe associated with a reservoir so that the data is plotted with the\nreservoir data.\n\nThe model consists of four sources, two sinks, and one reservoir\n\n![img](model.png)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Setting up the model\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We need to load all required libraries and all classes we want to\nuse. Interaction with the model classes is done through keyword/value\npairs. Use `help()` to inquire about the supported keyword value\npairs.\n\nESBMTK is unit aware. The units are used to map all input data to\ninternal units. The type of internal units needs to specified when\ncreating the model object. The time unit is derived from the timestep\nvariable. I.e., if the timestep is given in seconds, all other time\nrelated input will be mapped to seconds. Similarly you have to define\nthe base mass unit. Typically, this will be moles, but other units\nlike grams etc can also be used.  At present ESBMTK cannot convert\nbetween different types of mass units (e.g., kg to moles).  The usual\nprefixes like kilo, mega, milli etc are recognized. Volume units like\n`l` or `m**3` are recognized as well. ESBMTK also defines the sverdrup\n(\"Sv\")\n\nOnce the input units are mapped to base units specified by the model\nobject, all data will be reported in the base units. The only\nexception is the `object.plot()` method which will transform the data\nback into the original unit. In other words, if your timestep is in\nyears, but you specify your endtime in kyrs, the time axis will be\nplotted in kyrs. Similarly for all other data, with the exception of\nthe isotope delta values.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from esbmtk import Model, Element, Species, Reservoir\nfrom esbmtk import Signal, Connect, Source, Sink, Flux\nfrom esbmtk import ExternalData\n\n# create model\nModel(\n    name=\"C_Cycle\",     # model name\n    stop=\"200 yrs\",     # end time of model\n    timestep=\" 1 yr\",   # time unit\n    mass_unit = \"mol\",  # mass unit\n    volume_unit = \"l\",  # volume unit\n)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Declare elements and species\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We register the elements(s) with the model by providing the model\nname.

This data will be added to the\n`Fossil_Fuel_Burning_to_Ocean` flux (since the process is additive,\nthe initial flux has to be zero!)\n\nThe type of flux depends on how we specify the connection.
