Interaction with external data is handled through the\nexternal data object which allows to integrate external data into the\nmodel framework. It can then be used to generate a signal, or it can\nbe associated with a reservoir so that the data is plotted with the\nreservoir data.\n\nThe model consists of four sources, two sinks, and one reservoir.

Interaction with the model classes is done through keyword/value\npairs. Use `help()` to inquire about the supported keyword value\npairs.\n\nESBMTK is unit aware. The units are used to map all input data to\ninternal units. The type of internal units needs to specified when\ncreating the model object. The time unit is derived from the timestep\nvariable. I.e., if the timestep is given in seconds, all other time\nrelated input will be mapped to seconds. Similarly you have to define\nthe base mass unit. Typically, this will be moles, but other units\nlike grams etc can also be used.  At present ESBMTK cannot convert\nbetween different types of mass units (e.g., kg to moles).  The usual\nprefixes like kilo, mega, milli etc are recognized. Volume units like\n`l` or `m**3` are recognized as well. ESBMTK also defines the sverdrup\n(\"Sv\")\n\nOnce the input units are mapped to base units specified by the model\nobject, all data will be reported in the base units. The only\nexception is the `object.plot()` method which will transform the data\nback into the original unit. In other words, if your timestep is in\nyears, but you specify your endtime in kyrs, the time axis will be\nplotted in kyrs.

In the\nprevious example we provided a signal, so the flux will change with\ntime according to the signal data. If you look at the connection\nbetween `Carbonate_Weathering` and `Ocean` below, we specify a given\nrate and delta value. So this flux will not change over time. If you\nlook at the connection between `Ocean` and `OM_burial` the connection\nspecifies a constant flux but with an `alpha = -26.3`. This indicates\nthat this flux involves a fixed isotope offset relative to the\nupstream reservoir, i.e., the isotope ratio of this flux will change\ndynamically in response to the isotope ratio of the reservoir, but\nwith a constant offset.\n\nThe carbonate burial flux additionally specifies a reference value for\nthe DIC concentration. The model will modify this flux in such away\nthat the reservoirs returns to this concentration setpoint.
