# ESBMTK - The  Earth Sciences Box Modeling Toolkit

ESBMTK is a python library that aims to simplify typical box modeling
projects in the Earth-Sciences. The basic API is now stable, but the code to deploy complex models is still being improved. See the manual at <https://esbmtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest> for installation instructions and usage.
