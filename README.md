# ESBMTK - An Earth-sciences box modeling toolkit

ESBMTK is python library which aims to simplify typical box modeling
projects the in Earth-Sciences. The focus of this project is to make
box modeling more approachable for classroom teaching. So performance
and scalability are not great.

At present, it will calculate masses/concentrations in reservoirs and
fluxes including isotope ratios. It provides a variety of classes
which allow the creation and manipulation of input signals, and the
generation of graphical result. There is however no support for
chemical reactions (including equilibrium reactions).
